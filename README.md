GUI designed using appJar:

This is a simple PDF Manipulator application that is useful for pulling out certain pages from a PDF document (splitting) or blending two PDF files together (merging).

In my use case, I compiled this to Windows EXE using pyinstaller (https://www.pyinstaller.org/) and the --onefile option. Instructions for this (and other operating systems) to be added later.
